# CS 1.2: Introduction to Data Structures

## Course Description

A course that looks under the hood at data structures and algorithms to see how they work. In addition to implementing these structures in an application; students will build them from scratch, analyze their complexity, and benchmark their performance to gain an understanding of their tradeoffs and when to use them in practice.

## Course Specifics

**Course Delivery**: online | 7 weeks | 13 sessions

**Course Credits**: 3 units | 37.5 Seat Hours | 75 Total Hours

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Implement core linear and non-linear data structures.
1. Understand the advantages and applications of different data structures.
1. Implement search and soring alogirthms and analyze their complexities.
1. Solve open ended real-world and interview problems and select appropriate data structures/algorithms based on requirements.
